=head1 NAME

kgb.conf -- KGB bot configuration file

=head1 DESCRIPTION

F<kgb.conf> is the main configuration file of the KGB bot. Its location is in
F</etc/kgb-bot/> unless changed with the B<--conf> command line option. See
L<kgb-bot(1)>.

The file format is YAML. Elaborate example configuration is at the end of this
document.

=head1 Settings

=head2 soap

A map with the following possible keys:

=over

=item B<server_addr>

IP address to listen to. Defaults to C<127.0.0.1>.

For making KGB bot listen on all addresses, set the value to
C<0.0.0.0>.

=item B<server_port>

Port to listen to.

=item B<service_name>

SOAP service name. Defaults to C<KGB>.

=back

=head2 pid_dir

Directory to store PID file to. Defautls to F</var/run/kgb-bot/>.

=head2 include

Path to file with additional configuration. May be a path to a directory, in
which case all files in it ending with C<.conf> are loaded, in alphabetical
order.

=head2 min_protocol_version

Minimum version of the protocol that will be supported by the server. Defaults
to C<1>. Protocol version 0 has no authentication.

=head2 queue_limit

When messages are sent to IRC, there is certain rate limitting, which may
prevent the message to be sent right away. In this case messages are enqueued,
and this parameter configures the size of the queue. When the queue is full
client requests are rejected.

=head2 repositories

A map with keys project names and values maps with project details:

=over

=item password

Password used for authenticating all requests from this project.

=item private

If true, disables commit announces to 'broadcast' IRC channels.

=back

=head2 networks

A map with keys network names and values map of network configuration,
containing the following items:

=over

=item server

=item flood

If defined to a true value, the built-in rate-limitting feature of the IRC
component will be turned off. B<WARNING>: this may cause the bot to be kicked
off the IRC network. Use only when you control both the bot and the IRC network
(e.g. when testing).

=back

=head2 channels

A list of channels. Each element is a map and represents the channel's
configuration:

=over

=item name

Channel name, e.g. C<#commits>. B<Mandatory>.

=item network

Network name, as described in the B<networks> map. B<Mandatory>.

=item broadcast

Enables broadcasting all commit notifications to this channel.

=item repos

A list of project names, as described in the B<repositories> map. Mandatory
unless broadcast is enabled.

=item smart_answers

Each channel can contain separate list of smart answers, see below.

=back

=head2 smart_answers

A list of strings to be used as replies when the bot is addressed on IRC.

=head2 smart_answers_polygen

bot is addressed on IRC.

=head2 debug

Enables logging of additional diagnostic information.

=head2 admins

A list of IRC masks, used to determine if a given IRC nick is bot
administrator. Note that currently these nicks have no additional power.
