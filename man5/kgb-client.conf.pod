=head1 NAME

kgb-client.conf -- KGB client configuration file

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<kgb-client(1)> can be configured via command line options and/or via a
configuration file (via the B<--conf> option). Most of the settings can use
either way, with command line options overriding settings from the
configuration file.

The file format is YAML. Elaborate example configuration is at the end of this
document.

=head1 Settings

=head2 repo-id

Unique project identifier on the server. B<Mandatory>.

=head2 password

Pass phrase string. Used together with B<repo-id> to authenticate the request
to the servers. Per-server configuration overrides this setting.

=head2 timeout

Request timeout in seconds. Defaults to C<15>.

=head2 servers

A list of maps, describing the servers to try to send ntifications to. Each server map
can have the following members:

=over

=item B<uri>

The URI of the server. Something like C<http://kgb.server.org:port/>.

=item B<proxy>

SOAP proxy to use. Mandatory if using SOAP protocol. Defaults to to the value
of the B<uri> setting, with C<?session=KGB> appended.

=item B<password>

Per-server pass phrase. Defaults to the global B<password> setting.

=item B<timeout>

Timeout of the request. Defaults to the global B<timeout> setting.

=back

=head2 status_dir

Directory to store information about the last successfuly contacted server. If
the request is soon after the last contact, the last server is tried first.
This way related notifications tend to come out of the same server.

=head2 B<branch-and-module-re>

A list of regular expressions. These are matched against the path of the
modified files and should have two captures in them -- the first capture is for
the branch and the second capture is for the module.

This is useful with Subversion repositories where there is a single repository
for the project, with all the modules and branches.

=head2 B<module-and-branch-re>

Same as B<branch-and-module-re>, but captures are in reverse order -- module
first and branch second.

=head2 B<ignore-branch>

A name of a branch to ignore. All changes in that branch are sent without branch info. Useful if most of the branches are made in one branch (trunk, master).

=head2 B<web-link>

URL containing information about the commit (gitweb, viewvcs). C<${commit}>,
C<${branch}> and C<${module}> in that string are substituted with the commit
ID, the branch name and the module name respectively.

See L<App::KGB::Client> for examples.

=head2 B<short-url-service>

The name of the URL shortening service to use. See L<WWW::Shorten> for the list
of available services. Note that B<kgb-client> comes with an additional service
called C<Debli>, which is primarily useful for clients running on Debian's
collaboration server, alioth.

=head2 B<single-line-commits>

Send only a single line of the commit message to the channel.
Possible values: auto|force|off, default: auto.

=head2 B<use-irc-notices>

If set to a true value will make the IRC bot use IRC C<notice> messages instead
of the ordinary C<privmsg> messages.

=head2 B<use-color>

It set to a false value will make the IRC bot use no color in the
notifications.
