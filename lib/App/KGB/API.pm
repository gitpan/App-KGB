=head1 NAME

App::KGB::API -- KGB bot API documentation

=head1 VERSION 4 (JSON)

=head2 General, authentication

Version 4 uses JSON-RPC as described in
L<http://http://json-rpc.org/wiki/specification> with one extension. Since all
requests are authenticated, two HTTP headers need to be included:

=over

=item X-KGB-Project: project-name

=item X-KGB-Auth: hash

=back

The project name is the string identifying the project on the server side, and
the hash is the hexadecimal representation of the SHA-1 hash calculated over
the following data:

=over

=item Project password

This is the shared password known to the client and the server.

=item project-name

=item request-text

This is the JSON-encoded request text. The same that is sent in the HTTP body.

=back

=head2 Commit notification

Request is a JSON-RPC call to a method called B<commit_v4> with a single
argument, which is a map with the following possible keys:

=over

=item repo_id I<project-name>

=item rev_prefix I<revision-prefix>

Usualy C<r> for Subversion commits

=item commit_id I<commit id>

Subversion revision, Git hash or just empty (for CVS).

=item changes I<changes list>

A list of changes, encoded as strings. It is simple file name prepended with
C<(A)> for added, C<(M)> (or nothing) for modified and C<(D)> for deleted. See
L<App::KGB::Change>.

=item commit_log I<log message>

=item author I<user/name>

=item branch I<branch name>

=item module I<module name>

=item extra I<additional information>

A map with extra information. Currently C<web_link> is the only member that the
server recognises.

=back

=head2 Plain message relay

The message relay calls are to the B<relay_message> method, with the only
argument the message to be relayed.
