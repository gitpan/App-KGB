=head1 NAME

App::KGB::Client::CVS - KGB interface to CVS

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use App::KGB::Client::CVS;
    my $client = App::KGB::Client::CVS(
        # common App::KGB::Client parameters
        repo_id => 'my-repo',
        ...
        # CVS-specific
        cvs_root  => $ENV{CVSROOT},
        author    => $ENV{USER},
        directory => 'module/dir',
    );
    $client->run;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<App::KGB::Client::CVS> provides CVS-specific retrieval of
commits and changes for L<App::KGB::Client>.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 B<new> ( { initializers } )

Standard constructor. Accepts inline hash with initial field values.

=head1 FIELDS

App:KGB::Client::CVS defines the following additional fields:

=over

=item B<cvs_root> (B<mandatory>)

Physical path to the CVS root directory.

=item B<author>

The user name of the commit author.

=item B<directory>

Relative (to CVS root) path to the directory this change is in.

As a convention, the first path member is taken as a module.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item describe_commit

The first time this method is called, it parses STDIN and determines commit
contents, returning an instance of L<App::KGB::Commit> class describing the
commit.

All subsequential invocations return B<undef>.
