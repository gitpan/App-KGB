# repo-id is mandatory
repo-id: foo
# optional list of regular expressions for matching branch and module name each
# entry is matched against the changed path, $1 is supposed to be the branch
# name, $2 - the module (package) name
# forward slashes are escaped, so no special treatment is needed here
# the sample is taken from pkg-perl SVN repository, which is Layout 2 (all
# trunks under trunk/ and has a special place for applications and
# almost-removed stuff)
branch-and-module-re:
 - "/(trunk|tags|apps|attic)/([^/]+)"
 - "/branches/([^/]+)/([^/]+)"
# for layout 1 package -> trunk/branches/tags) naturally the package name comes
# into $1 and the branch - into $2. To remedy the situation, use the other
# variant:
# module-and-branch-re:
# - "/packages/([^/]+)/branches/([^/]+)"
# - "/packages/([^/]+)/(?:trunk|tags)/([^/]+)"

# some global parameters can be set for all servers
password: "very secret"
timeout: 15
# also, a single server can be defined with 'uri'
# uri: htp://somewhere/
# or, a failover group of servers can be defined
servers:
 - uri: http://localhost:9999/
   timeout: 5 # no point in waiting longer for localhost
 - uri: http://remotehost:9999/
   password: "overrides the global one"
# status-dir is used to store the last successfuly contacted server
# this information is used later in order to try to contact the same server
# again (if later contact is within some not very big time frame)
status-dir: /var/cache/kgb/client-status
# a commit URL template to send to the server
# ${module}, ${branch} and ${commit} are replaced with the data from the commit
# Examples:
#  "http://svn.debian.org/viewvc/kgb?view=revision&revision=${commit}"
#  "http://git.debian.org/?p=our-project/${module}.git;a=commitdiff;h=${commit}"
