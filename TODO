* split kgb-bot into manageable modules
* start a real test bot for automated tests
  - this is now possible via eg/start-test-bot-[12] and 'TEST_KGB_BOT_RUNNING=1
    make test'
    even if useful for local testing the results aren't verified via t/*.t
* write tests for CVS client

* watch file broken; depending on the UA, alioth replies with
  "406 Not Acceptable"

* admin/sync -- needs a plan
  Plan A
  ======
  - we need a system which would allow individual instances' admins to update
    some central configuration store, which is both encrypted and signed.
  - that central store could be fetched by the bots regularly, the signature
    verified, and then the changes applied.
  - the central storage could be on alioth, but the signing should be done
    remotely somehow (who wants to upload her secret hey to alioth? :))
    there could be a tool that automates the signing process (download from
    alioth, start $EDITOR or add config from command line, sign, upload)
  - the bots need to be given a keyring with trusted keys, whose signatures
    they recognise

  Pros:
   - powerful
   - possible addition/modification and removal of project
   - full encryption end-to-end
  Cons:
   - GPG integration in the bot
   - complex configuraion retrieval
   - changes need time to propagate
   - non-trivial creation of changes

  Plan B
  ======
  - bots recognize a new message for adding projects
    the message is accompanied with a hash over its contents, the timestamp of
    the sender, and a shared secret (uses the current json protocol
    implementation, but with another secret)
  - any of the admins wanting to add project would run a tool which connects
    with all the bots sending them the signed message

  Pros:
   - relatively simple
   - instant update
  Cons:
   - no encryption
   - only addition of projects (can be addressed by creating another message
     for project deletion, and assuming that messages for existing projects
     replace their configuration)

  Plan C
  ======
  - do nothing. We managed somehow to maintain the service by hand, only with
    kgb-add-project

  Pros:
   - requires no effort
  Cons:
   - requires small effort (Ã—3) every now and then
