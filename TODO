* split kgb-bot into manageable modules
* start a real test bot for automated tests
  - this is now possible via eg/start-test-bot-[12] and 'TEST_KGB_BOT_RUNNING=1
    make test'
    even if useful for local testing the results aren't verified via t/*.t
* write tests for CVS client
* Move URL shortening to bot (configurable)
* admin/sync -- needs a plan
* client: verify config file structure strictly and die (warn?) if something is
  wrong. for example, servers should be a list of maps, and not a map
